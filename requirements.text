1.Python 3.x
  The main programming language used.


2.Standard Libraries
   abc – For defining abstract base classes
   typing – For type hints (List, Set, Dict, etc.)
   tkinter – For building the GUI (comes built-in with Python)
   random – Used for puzzle generation or shuffling
   copy – For deep copying puzzle states during solving
   time – For performance tracking or delays (if used)



3.Third-Party Libraries
  
  NumPy
   Efficient 2D grid management and numeric operations

   bash
   pip install numpy



4.Testing & Development Tools
  unittest (built-in)
   For writing and running unit tests on puzzle logic

  Pylint / Flake8 / Black (optional but recommended)
   Code linters and formatters to ensure clean, readable code

   bash
   pip install pylint flake8 black



5.Virtualenv 
   To isolate your Python environment

   bash
   pip install virtualenv


6.Optional (For Future Enhancements)
If you plan to implement features like online puzzle importing, AI solvers, or visualizations, you might consider:

 requests – for API calls
 matplotlib – for plotting stats or solving time
 pandas – for logging and tracking scores/history
