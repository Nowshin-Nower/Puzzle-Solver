Project Overview
The Logic Puzzle Solver is a Python-based software application that automatically solves complex logic puzzles — currently focused on Sudoku and Kakuro. It uses advanced Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) solving techniques, wrapped inside a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter.


What It Does
1.Solves puzzles like Sudoku (9x9 grids with unique numbers in rows/columns/boxes) and Kakuro (crossword-style numeric puzzles where numbers must sum to given clues).

2.Uses AI-style solving algorithms: backtracking, constraint propagation, and domain pruning to efficiently find solutions.

3.Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can:

-Load puzzles

-Input numbers

-Request hints or solutions

-Track scores and attempts


How It Works
The project is structured in modular layers, using Object-Oriented Programming:

1. Puzzle Logic Layer
-An abstract base class (LogicPuzzle) defines shared structure for puzzles.

-Subclasses like SudokuPuzzle and KakuroPuzzle implement specific rules.

-Each puzzle class includes:

  Grid initialization

  Constraint checking (e.g., no repeated numbers, sum totals)

  Domain calculation (valid value possibilities)

2. Solving Engine
-Core algorithm is backtracking:

  Tries a value → checks constraints → continues if valid.

  If stuck, it backtracks and tries other values.

-Uses constraint propagation to eliminate bad options early.

-Domain reduction trims down choices before deep search starts.

3. Graphical Interface (GUI)
-Built with Tkinter

-Allows interaction: puzzle selection, cell input, error highlighting, scoring, and feedback.

-Designed to be intuitive and visually friendly.


Architecture in Simple Terms
Imagine it like this:

sql
[ User ] <==> [ GUI ] <==> [ Puzzle Logic ] <==> [ Solver Engine ]
You input a puzzle → GUI captures it → logic module interprets it → solver runs algorithm → solution goes back up to GUI.


Key Features
1.Modular Design: You can add new puzzles like KenKen or Nonograms by extending existing classes.

2.Algorithms at Work:

-Backtracking: Trial-and-error approach with smart pruning.

-Constraint Propagation: Before trying values, eliminate the obviously invalid ones.

-Domain Reduction: Reduce possibilities to make the search faster.

3.GUI:

-Real-time feedback

-Hint button

-Error highlights

-Accessibility options


Why It’s Valuable
1.Educational: Shows how constraint satisfaction and backtracking work in practice.

2.Extensible: Easily add new puzzles by inheriting from a base class.

3.User-centric: The GUI is built for interaction, not just testing.

4.Efficient: Optimized for speed with smart heuristics and pruning.

5.Scalable: Future plans include AI hints, multi-threading, and web/mobile ports.


Performance Notes
1.Time complexity can be high in worst-case puzzles (especially for backtracking).

2.Optimizations help keep it practical: early exits, forward checking, and caching.

3.As puzzles get harder or bigger (e.g. 16x16 Sudoku), smarter heuristics will play a bigger role.


Who Is This For?
1.Puzzle lovers who want to experiment with logic solvers

2.AI learners exploring constraint satisfaction problems

3.Developers wanting to see how to combine backend algorithms with frontend interfaces

4.Educators demonstrating AI concepts using visual tools
